# FMovies Sync

Sync playback in FMovies.

## Description

This is a simple application that adds a synchronizing functionality to the player in FMovies, allowing the participants to watche de movie at the same time.

Under the hood, this adds a button to the player using a Tampermonkey script; this script connects to a node running in Heroku using Socket.IO and broadcasts any command for each movie to all the participants.

This was developed as a need to watch movies at the same time by a group of friends during the lockdown for COVID-19 in 2020. If you're one of the lucky participants, you can check the page for [Ciclo de Cine de Mierda remote revival](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2547474055473448/).

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) on your browser, for instance [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).
2. Add the [FMovies Sync client](https://github.com/dsmania/fmovies-sync/raw/master/fmovies-sync-client.user.js) script.
3. *Whitelist fmovies.to in AdBlock*

Note that this will most probably also run with any userscript extension like [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), it has just not been tested.
AdBlock is currently preventing the script to work normally, to make it work it's required to either whitelist fmovies.to, which would bloat the page with ads, or mcloud.to, mcloud1.to, mcloud2.to, mcloud3.to... and any subsequent variants. Whitelisting mcloud.to should both prevent ads and make the script work but since there's a range of variants that is assigned dynamically, any of them should be added independently.

## Usage

1. Go to [Fmovies](https://fmovies.to/).
2. Select a show.
3. Click the sync button [â‡†] in the player.
4. Any playback control is now synchronized with all other participants.
